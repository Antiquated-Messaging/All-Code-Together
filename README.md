# All-Code-Together

### This is the main repository!!

This code can take an input from a user and translate it either into a numeric code, a cipher, or morse code. It will then save the translated message in a .txt document titled "message from [sender] to [recipient]"

-Jonathan worked on the cipher class, the saver class, and the main code

-The group checked each other's code as well, to make sure it would all be compatible in the final code
