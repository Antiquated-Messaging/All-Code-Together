# All-Code-Together

### This is the main repository!!

This code can take an input from a user and translate it either into a numeric code, a cipher, or morse code. It will then save the translated message in a .txt document titled "message from [sender] to [recipient]"

- Jonathan worked on the cipher class, the saver class, and the main code

- Matthew worked on the numeric class

- Ben worked on the morse code class

- The group checked each other's code as well, to make sure it would all be compatible in the final code

Matt: I enjoyed this group project and using github as a collaborative space to share our codes. Github enabled us to all have the same folder and classes on our computers to work on, however I still believe having one code is more streamlined than a github folder that borrows classes frome achother. Jonathan and Ben were very knowledgeable about classes and helped me with errors in my code when they occured. I also was happy with our collaborativeness and sharing of code, as there were certain parts of my code that enabled me to help Ben with his morse code. Overall, this was a good experience to start the winter term.
