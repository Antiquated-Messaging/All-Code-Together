# All-Code-Together

### This is the main repository!!

This code can take an input from a user and translate it either into a numeric code, a cipher, or morse code. It will then save the translated message in a .txt document titled "message from [sender] to [recipient]"

- Jonathan worked on the cipher class, the saver class, and the main code

- Matthew worked on the numeric class

- Ben worked on the morse code class

- The group checked each other's code as well, to make sure it would all be compatible in the final code

Matt: I enjoyed this group project and using github as a collaborative space to share our codes. Github enabled us to all have the same folder and classes on our computers to work on, however I still believe having one code is more streamlined than a github folder that borrows classes frome achother. Jonathan and Ben were very knowledgeable about classes and helped me with errors in my code when they occured. I also was happy with our collaborativeness and sharing of code, as there were certain parts of my code that enabled me to help Ben with his morse code. Overall, this was a good experience to start the winter term.

Ben: I thought that this was a fun group project. I also thought that using the Github application made the entire collaborative project more feasible since we could all be writing our code all at once and we could upload the code when desired. I thought that the three of us all worked together and that my partners were really able to help me with my code when I needed it. 

Jon: I enjoyed this project a lot, and I thought github was an effective way of organizing code. Using github, as well as separate files to implement classes, made keeping everything together much easier. It was also useful that we could all see each other's code, and help each other even if we weren't next to each other. It was definitely useful that you can type in your own text-editor, but for a quick fix you can just edit your code on the website. Overall, I think github helped make coding and organization within our groups much easier.
